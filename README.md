# Mattereum_Hackday_Moon
Art and Ownership and Blockchains!


##What this is

The high level concept here is to create a sort of standard repository of contracts which give _legal_ rights to a physical item (in this case we're considering primarily art).

The piece of art needs to have a few things

    * Identity - as a uuid, private/public keypair, or something else

    * An original _legal_ contract that defines the rights of the artwork as well as the rights of ownership and the transfer thereof

    * A smart contract or set of smart contracts that mediates transactions or modifications of those rights on-chain

    * Maybe: a token or tokens that describe or maintain whatever state of ownership, royalties or derivative properties that the art has. 


##Goals for this weekend

We want to stand up an MVP that is aspirationally ready to mediate a real transfer of ownership for a piece of real art, and possibly even an art show/sale. 

This means covering three fundamental bases: 
  * physical
  * legal
  * ethereal
